# dino-RED

## A Python implementation of the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm applied to the classic Chrome Dinosaur endless runner.

This project demonstrates an autonomous agent that evolves neural network topologies from scratch to master obstacle avoidance. The agent operates in real-time, learning optimal jump strategies through genetic variation and selection without pre-programmed heuristics.
