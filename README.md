##  **A.I. Chrome Dinosaur** in **Python** using **Pygame** and **NEAT Algorithm**! 🦖

## Description

This is the **Chrome Dino Game** using **NEAT** and **Pygame** written in **Python**. 

In this project, NEAT is used to train an AI to play the Chrome Dino Game.This is a simple infinite runner where the player has to jump over cactus and avoid birds. 
The game gets progressively harder as the player's score increases.

## Controls
- You don't need to control the dinosaur. The AI :)

## Libraries

- [pygame]: Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games.
- [NEAT]: NEAT is a method developed by Kenneth O. Stanley for evolving arbitrary neural networks.
